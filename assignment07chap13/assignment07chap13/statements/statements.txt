This application demonstrated the overload of input and output operator. 
The difficulty I found with this was nearing the end of the project.
Having to set failbit within the input after checking the size of the input 
and using putback continued to fail to work appropriately. 
Checking the input stream for more characters continued to through a failbit 
due to not checking for explicitly the new line character. References continued to 
emphasize using the \0 or using the method eof which would return -1 / false.
None of these worked but after utilizing the peek method and checking 
for \n it has worked flawlessly.
