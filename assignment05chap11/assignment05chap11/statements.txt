This application showed the importance of overriding functions and providing preset (interface) with inheritance for classes that are similar in a “is:a” relationship. 
I had originally forgotten two things. Changing the tostring function within package to virtual and correctly adding the vectors in main to allot for the proper class. 
Initially it continued to only print out of package and not the overridden function. 
I learned an important feature added into c++11 which is override. 
I commonly use this in java for the @override annotation but within c++ this allows you to validate if a class is actually being overridden or not.
