Assignment 03 provided information on static members and classes. The program was challenging in the aspects of dialing back what I wanted the class to look and perform like unlike the requirements. This was mainly a challenge on providing what “management” would want instead of what I would prefer to write. For example I would personally have had the classes organization differently and wanted to add more checks and balances. Such as a checker for verifying the order customer id matched a real customer ID by self checking.
