This program was great for learning premade algorithms and how to use them. I know re-inventing the wheel is bad, but it is common having to explain how the wheel works and the best way is having to do it. Iâ€™ve studied up on algorithms a lot on different medians and glad I did due to the ability being able to do all of these without a library, making it easier to use outdated versions of c++ and java.
