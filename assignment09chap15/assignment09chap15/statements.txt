I found this program to be very draining. Containers are important but using them for more than their basic functions are the fun part of containers. 
Essentially this was taking 16 containers having 3 functions each (including print), now at 48 objectives, becoming just a mundane waste of a couple of hours.  
Furthermore, I’d suggest something that utilizes containers and help understand them better. 
Great practice problems can be found on hackerank, leetcode, and etc. 
Personally find that leetcode helps more with container practice, a bit more challenging, and something other than dull busy work.
