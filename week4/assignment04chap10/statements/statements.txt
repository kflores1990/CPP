This application demonstrated operator overloading. I noticed I kept having an issue with the decrement and increment function. I knew my functions were written correctly but continued to display incorrect numbers. This was due to the ‘pre/post-incremented’ message call was after the operation had been performed. Overall, the assignment was straightforward, just need to be more meticulous in my display calls or (and) using the debugger more often.
